In this section, we compare size distributions of natural and experimental populations, and explore how the size distribution predicted by the two-sex MPM affects our conclusions about the role of males in range boundary formation. 

\subsection*{Observed and predicted size distributions}

\paragraph{Natural populations}
During natural population surveys (2012--2013) we recorded the area ($m^2$) of Texas bluegrass patches using a Trimble GeoExplorer hand-held GPS receiever with sub-meter accuracy. 

\paragraph{Common garden populations}
Common garden data collection included tiller counts and the maximum length and width of each patch, which we converted to area ($m^2$) assuming an oval shape. 
We used these data to estimate the relationship between patch area and tiller count (Fig. \ref{fig:area_tillers_conversion}) using a generalized additive model \citep{mgcv} and applied this fitted relationship to area measurements from natural populations.
This allowed us to compare the size distributions of natural and common garden populations (pooled across the range) in the same size unit (log(tillers)).

\newpage
\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{Figures/area_tillers_conversion}
		\caption{Relationship between area ($m^2$) and tiller count from plants in the common garden experiment. 
			The fitted gam model (line) was used to convert area measurements from natural populations to tiller counts.}
		\label{fig:area_tillers_conversion}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Two-sex MPM}
The two-sex MPM predicts asymptotic population structure, including stable size distribution (SSD) and sex ratio. 
For comparison with empirical data, we calculated the SSD (pooling both sexes) predicted in the center of the range (the conclusions that we draw from this analysis hold up if we consider SSD from different parts of the range).
Because the MPM is structured by tiller number, we converted the SSD to log(tillers) by simulating an arbirarily large ($10000$) population at SSD, taking the natural logarithm of tiller number, and then estimating the empirical distribution of this variable.

			In \textbf{C}, the two size distributions come from the base model parameterized following methods described in the main manuscript (``field model'', in gray) and a numerical experiment where growth parameters were numerically increased to generate a size distribution more consistent with natural populations (``elevated growth model'', in white). 
		}
		\label{fig:size_dist}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Results}
Plants from natural populations were larger, on average, than plants in our common garden experiment (Fig. \ref{fig:size_dist}A,B).
Common garden plants were generally larger each year but the largest sizes in the final year of the common garden corresponded to smaller sizes observed in natural populations (although natural population surveys were subject to detection bias: small plants were likely under-sampled relative to their occurrence). 
The predicted SSD from the two-sex MPM was consistent with the common garden size distribution (Fig. \ref{fig:size_dist}C), as expected since the model was built with common garden data. 
These results suggest that common garden plants did not have the same growth trajectories of naturally occurring plants and / or were not given sufficient time to reach the sizes observed in natural populations. 

\subsection*{Numerical experiment to explore the consequences of under-estimating the size distribution}
The preceding results indicate that the common garden populations, and thus the two-sex MPM built from common garden data, under-estimate the size distribution of Texas bluegrass, relative to what we find in natural populations. 
Sex differences in demography, and especially flowering, were most pronounced for the largest sizes (Fig. 4), but these sizes were predicted to be very rare in a stable population (Fig. \ref{fig:size_dist}C). 
The under-estimation of large sizes may explain why longitudinal clines in OSR predicted by the MPM and seen in the common garden were weaker than the OSR cline observed in natural populations (Fig. \ref{fig:SR_viab_sens}). 
It is therefore possible that our main finding -- that males contribute little-to-nothing toward range limitation -- reflects a limitation of the model, since real populations tended to be more female-biased (and potentially more mate-limited) in the eastern range margins than the model predicted.
To explore this possibility, we conducted a numerical experiment that allowed modeled plants to reach larger sizes by increasing the empirically-estimated intercept of the growth vital rate function by a factor of $2.75$ (values larger than this caused numerical instabilities).
This adjustment caused all plants to increase in size more strongly regardless of initial size, sex, or geographic location. 
We also increased the upper size limit to $U*1.5$.

As expected, this led to stronger sex ratio clines and stronger reductions in seed viability at eastern range margins (Fig. \ref{fig:elevated_growth_SR_viab}). 
These changes increased the contributions of males to eastern range limitation in the elevated-growth numerical experiment.
However, the contribution of males to range limitation was still weak relative to that of females (the maximum male contribution was less than half of the female maximum) and differences between the two-sex and female-dominant MPMs were stil very minor (Fig. \ref{fig:elevated_growth_model}). 
Collectively, these results suggest that the small size distribution of the common garden experiment led to a weaker role of males than would be expected in populations with a more realistic size distribution, but that even with a larger size distribution, declines in female performance still dominante range boundary formation.
